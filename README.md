Hi my name is Macoy. As a fresh graduate, I have interests to build a long-term career in the field of Web development,
Software development, or Quality Assurance. I have internship experience on being a Quality
Assurance. I have also taken courses and certifications in Cybersecurity, C, C++, Python, Java, SQL
and HTML. I take online courses in my free time to enhance my skill set and knowledge.

Right now I am exploring web development in which I find it really fun.
